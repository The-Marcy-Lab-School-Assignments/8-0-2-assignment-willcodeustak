# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

Environment variables are settings that store configuration information, such as API keys, database credentials, or system paths.

These values are defined outside the application, typically in the system or a file like .env, so you can manage them separately from the codebase. This has two affects

sensitive information out of the code
makes the application easier to configure for different environments.
In Node.js, you access environment variables through the process.env object, which holds the variables as properties. environment variable names are case-sensitive and typically written in uppercase.

For example, process.env.KEY retrieves the value of the key variable.
