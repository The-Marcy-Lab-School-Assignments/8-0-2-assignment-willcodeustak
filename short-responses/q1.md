# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Making API requests from the front end leaves room for vulnerability. It is not hidden and can be seen by users by simply console.log'ing. Since we are fetching with the key every time we want to get something to render etc, we always risk exposing our key.

By making the request to our server instead we can hide it from users since it only goes through our "controlled" environment meaning we do not have to outsource information , instead we use our own backend.
